# Slackbot

Building this slackbot to respond end users questions
Use case - Support bot 

This code uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create a simple chatbot that can answer questions by finding the closest matching question from a list of FAQs and returning the corresponding answer.

Here is a breakdown of the code:

The first two lines import the necessary modules: pandas, which is a data analysis library used to read the FAQs data from a CSV file, and scikit-learn (sklearn), which is a machine learning library used for the NLP processing.

The next few lines read the FAQs data from a CSV file and load it into a pandas DataFrame. This data contains a list of questions and their corresponding answers.

The text is then preprocessed by converting all the text to lowercase and removing any unnecessary spaces.

A TF-IDF vectorizer is created using the TfidfVectorizer() function. This vectorizer will be used to convert the questions into numerical feature vectors that can be used as input for the machine learning algorithm.

The fit_transform() method of the TF-IDF vectorizer is called to convert the list of questions into numerical feature vectors.

A Naive Bayes classifier is created using the MultinomialNB() function. This classifier will be trained on the numerical feature vectors created by the TF-IDF vectorizer.

The fit() method of the Naive Bayes classifier is called to train the model on the questions and answers.

A function named get_response() is defined. This function takes a user's question as input and returns the closest matching question from the FAQs list along with the corresponding answer.

The transform() method of the TF-IDF vectorizer is called to convert the user's question into a numerical feature vector.

The predict() method of the Naive Bayes classifier is called to predict the closest matching question from the FAQs list based on the numerical feature vector of the user's question.

The get_response() function returns the corresponding answer for the closest matching question.

The chatbot is then tested by running a loop that asks the user for a question, calls the get_response() function to get an answer, and prints the answer to the console. The loop continues until the user enters "exit".

Overall, this code provides a basic implementation of a chatbot using NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms. However, it should be noted that the chatbot's accuracy and effectiveness may vary depending on the quality and quantity of the FAQs data and the performance of the NLP and machine learning algorithms used.
